## General Information
- The project focuses on CFPB complaint and the data is made publicly available through the CFPB website. The CFPB collects the complaints, then sends them to the financial services companies for a response. We are interested in analyzing the complaints over time, company responses, and ongoing trends in the complaint data.

- For this project, we focused on topic extraction from complaints narratives.
- With the topic modelling, and the final output interface, the intention is to help CFPB to accelerate the complaint process, and be able to track topic models trend and patterns in complaint narrative. And with the interface, it is easy to predict the main topic on any new complaint narrative.
