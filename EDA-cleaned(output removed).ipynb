    "| Consumer complaint narrative | Consumer complaint narrative is the consumer-submitted description of \"what happened\" from the complaint. Consumers must opt-in to share their narrative. We will not publish the narrative unless the consumer consents, and consumers can opt-out at any time. The CFPB takes reasonable steps to scrub personal information from each complaint that could be used to identify the consumer. | plain text | Consumers' descriptions of what happened are included if consumers consent to publishing the description and after we take steps to remove personal information.  |\n",
    "| Company public response | The company's optional, public-facing response to a consumer's complaint. Companies can choose to select a response from a pre-set list of options that will be posted on the public database. For example, \"Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error.\" | plain text | Companies' public-facing responses to complaints are included if companies choose to publish one. Companies may select a public response from a set list of options as soon as they respond to the complaint, but no later than 180 days after the complaint was sent to the company for response. |\n",

    "| Tags | Data that supports easier searching and sorting of complaints submitted by or on behalf of consumers. For example, complaints where the submitter reports the age of the consumer as 62 years or older are tagged, ‘Older American.’ Complaints submitted by or on behalf of a servicemember or the spouse or dependent of a servicemember are tagged, ‘Servicemember.’ Servicemember includes anyone who is active duty, National Guard, or Reservist, as well as anyone who previously served and is a Veteran or retiree.  | plain text |   |\n",

We do not publish the narrative unless the consumer consents and consumers can opt-out at any time. | plaint text | This field shows whether a consumer provided consent to publish their complaint narrative. |\n",
